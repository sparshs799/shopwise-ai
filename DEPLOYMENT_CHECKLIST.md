   Search: "gaming laptops RTX 5090"

   ```

---

## üéâ SUCCESS CRITERIA

When everything works, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Frontend loads at shopwise-ai.vercel.app
- ‚úÖ Search returns products (not errors)
- ‚úÖ Products show from Amazon (16+)
- ‚úÖ Products show from Supabase (2)
- ‚úÖ Product cards have images and prices
- ‚úÖ "Compare Stores" button works
- ‚úÖ No CORS errors in browser console

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "404 Not Found" on Vercel
- Frontend deployed but backend URL is wrong
- Check Vercel env vars have correct Railway URL

### "CORS Error" in console
- Railway deployment failed or URL is incorrect
- Check Railway logs for errors

### "No products found"
- Web scraping might be blocked
- Check Railway logs for scraping errors
- Amazon should always work (16 products)

### Railway build fails
- Check build logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify `server/package.json` exists
- Make sure root directory is set to `server`

---

## üìû NEED HELP?

### Check Railway Logs:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click your service
3. Click "View Logs"
4. Look for errors

### Check Vercel Logs:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Go to Deployments
4. Click on latest deployment
5. Check "Build Logs" and "Function Logs"

### Test Locally First:
```powershell
# Backend
cd server
npm start
# Should run on port 3001

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd client
npm run dev
# Should run on port 5173
```

If localhost works but production doesn't, it's a deployment configuration issue.

---

## üí° ALTERNATIVE: Quick Test Without Railway

Want to see if it works on Vercel first?

1. Update `client/src/services/api.js`:
   ```javascript
   const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3001' // Use your backend
   ```

2. Keep your local backend running
3. Deploy only frontend to Vercel
4. Test if frontend works with local backend

This proves your frontend is fine, then you can deploy backend to Railway.

## üéØ ESTIMATED TIME

- GitHub setup: 5 minutes
- Railway deployment: 5 minutes
- Vercel configuration: 3 minutes
- Testing: 2 minutes
- **Total: ~15 minutes**
